## Birthday Voter

We exploit data on millions of people multiple state voter registration files to estimate whether people turn out more often if their birthday falls on the voting day. We conjecture that people see voting as a duty, and like doing dutiful things on their birthdays. To the extent that is true, it gives us evidence for voting as duty. Empirically, we expect effects to be larger during midterms, when people are less likely to vote. Voting more frequently on birthdays may also be driven by people taking the day off on their birthdays and using the time to vote. To the extent that is reason behind it, making election day an official holiday would increase turnout.
